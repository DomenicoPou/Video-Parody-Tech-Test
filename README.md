# Video Parody Tech Test
An ASP.NET React.js take on a popular video streaming service

This project uses ASP.NET Core to implement a simple React.js Website Inspired by a popular streaming service.

Although this program does use ASP.NET Core no C# Controllers are used. Due to time constraints.
Instead of manipulating data using C#, the program loads in data locally. Then manipulates the data with javascript.
In future iterations this program would have the C# portion implemented.
